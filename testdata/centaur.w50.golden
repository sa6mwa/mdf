[3m[34mA default operating mode for small, AI-augmented[0m
[3m[34mdelivery units.[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mPurpose[0m

The Centaur Manifest exists for one reason: to let
a small human unit move at machine speed without
losing coherence.

In the centaur era, execution is cheap. Drafting,
scaffolding, refactoring, exploration, and even
broad solution search can be delegated to capable
agents. The limiting factors shift. The hard work
becomes maintaining shared intent, bounding risk,
proving correctness, integrating safely, and
learning fast enough to steer.

This document is self-contained. It defines tenets
and a recommended way of working that makes those
tenets second nature.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mScope and relationship to organization-level[0m
   [1;34mframeworks[0m

This manifest is intentionally [3m[34munit-scale[0m: it is
optimized for 2–4 humans shipping and learning
fast with AI augmentation.

In many organizations, there is also a
portfolio/coordination layer whose job is to align
multiple teams, allocate attention across
competing outcomes, and keep a consistent
north-star focus under dependencies and politics.
Frameworks like [1m[1;37mOBAF[0m are built for that layer:
they are not an AI-augmented, two-person-team
runtime. A centaur unit should read OBAF-style
artifacts primarily as [1m[1;37mupstream intent and[0m
[1m[1;37mcoordination constraints[0m — a way to stay aligned
with a broader north-star — without importing
heavyweight planning/ceremony into a context where
coordination cost is already negligible.

If you are only a single small unit, the Centaur
kernel below is usually sufficient. If you become
many units with real dependencies, add the minimal
composition rules in this manifest (see [1m[1;37mScaling[0m
[1m[1;37mand composition[0m) and let the org-level layer do
what it is good at: outcome portfolio coherence.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mThe model[0m

A centaur unit is a [1m[1;37msmall team[0m (often 2–4 humans)
operating with AI augmentation. The unit is
defined less by headcount than by a capability
mix:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mDomain expertise[0m holds the truth about what
  matters, why it matters, who it matters to, and
  how to know if it changed.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mBuilding expertise[0m holds the truth about how
  change is made real: systems design,
  integration, reliability, security, operability,
  and proof.

A centaur unit may be one domain expert with one
builder, one domain expert with multiple builders,
or a builder with deep domain adjacency. The unit
remains [3m[34m"centaur"[0m so long as intent is explicit,
constraints are enforced, and evidence governs
direction.

AI is treated as an accelerator of execution and
exploration, not as an authority. Human judgment
remains responsible for intent, constraints, and
proof.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mThe tenets[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m1) Outcomes over outputs[0m

Outputs are deliverables; outcomes are observable
changes in the world.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m2) Evidence is the arbiter[0m

Plans are hypotheses. Confidence yields to
signals, observation, and reproducible checks.
Signals are [3m[34mlearning instruments[0m, not performance
targets. When a signal becomes a target, it
becomes easier to game and less useful as
evidence.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m3) Constraints are first-class[0m

Security, reliability, cost, compliance,
operability, and interfaces/contracts (boundaries
over heroics) are part of the outcome, not
deferred work.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m4) Verification dominates execution[0m

When generation is cheap, proof becomes the
bottleneck. Design work so correctness is
continuously demonstrable.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m5) Automation-first governance[0m

Policies live in pipelines and checks, not in
meetings and approvals. Automation must remain
[3m[34menabling[0m, not controlling. Automate constraints
and proof, not politics.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m6) Micro-iterations, small batches[0m

Short cycles reduce error, maximize learning rate,
and limit blast radius.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m7) One source of truth for intent[0m

A canonical intent artifact defines why, what
success means, and what must not break.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m8) Coordination is artifact-driven[0m

Async by default. Sync time is reserved for
irreducible human alignment. Ownership follows
capability and accountability, not titles.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m9) Maintain conceptual integrity under speed[0m

Protect shared mental models. Prevent drift as
change velocity rises.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m10) Capture learning while cheap[0m

Reflection is mandatory, lightweight, and tied to
events. Surprises must improve future work.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mRecommended implementation[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mReadiness check (quick diagnostic)[0m

A centaur unit can operate with very little
ceremony, but it cannot operate without minimum
cultural and technical preconditions. If you
answer "no" to many of these, fix the foundation
before you blame the method.

[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mIntent clarity:[0m Can we state the outcome in
      one sentence and agree on what would falsify
      it?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mEvidence access:[0m Do we have at least one
      trustworthy feedback loop (telemetry, user
      contact, ops signals) that updates on a
      useful cadence?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mConstraint authority:[0m Do we have the right
      to define/enforce the constraints that
      matter (security, reliability, cost
      ceilings, etc.)?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mAutonomy:[0m Can the unit change course based
      on evidence without escalation for every
      pivot?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mIntegration path:[0m Do we have CI/CD or an
      equivalent integration mechanism where
      guardrails can run continuously?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mDefinition of done:[0m Do we treat "done" as
      [3m[34mintegrated with proof[0m, not merely
      implemented?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mPsychological safety:[0m Can we run blameless
      micro-reviews where people can speak without
      punishment?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mDecision latency:[0m Can we make small
      decisions quickly without waiting on large
      meetings?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mDependency clarity:[0m If we depend on others,
      do we have explicit contracts/interfaces and
      a way to test them?
[36m-[0m [ ] [1m[1;37mSignal hygiene:[0m Do we review metrics/signals
      for gaming, vanity, and drift (at least
      monthly)?

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mThe Centaur kernel[0m

The recommended implementation is an operating
system, not a bureaucracy. It minimizes ceremony
and maximizes explicit state, because state is
what prevents small units (and their agents) from
diverging.

The kernel consists of five artifacts and three
loops. The artifacts hold intent, hypotheses,
verification, flow, and learning. The loops keep
the unit aligned with reality.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mThe artifacts[0m

The centaur unit relies on a small set of
artifacts that are always current. They are
designed to be read in minutes and updated
continuously.

[1m[1;37mThe Intent Card[0m is the single source of truth for
"what we are doing and why." It contains the
end-state, the purpose, the non-negotiable
constraints, and the signals that will tell you
whether the outcome is happening. The intent card
is not a requirements document. It is a contract
with reality: if the signals do not move, the unit
changes course.

[1m[1;37mThe Micro-Experiment Note[0m is the unit of progress.
It captures one hypothesis and one move. It
describes what you believe will happen, how you
will know, what would falsify the belief quickly,
and what the next action is. It is intentionally
small, because large hypotheses are expensive to
disprove and invite thrash.

[1m[1;37mThe Guardrail Pack[0m is executable governance. It is
the set of tests, checks, policies, and
observability expectations that must pass for work
to be considered integrated. It is versioned,
explicit, and treated as a living system. The
guardrail pack is how the unit keeps speed from
turning into fragility.

[1m[1;37mThe Flow Board[0m is a minimal representation of
work-in-progress. It exists to keep WIP low and to
make blocking visible. The board is not a planning
tool; it is a flow stabilizer.

[1m[1;37mThe Decision & Learning Log[0m captures the small
number of decisions that matter and the lessons
that changed the system. It is the memory of the
unit. Its purpose is not documentation; it is
preventing the unit from relitigating past choices
and repeating avoidable failures.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mThe loops[0m

The unit runs three loops concurrently. The loops
are short by design, because long loops are
incompatible with centaur iteration velocity.

[1m[1;37mLoop A: Continuous execution[0m is the default mode.
Work is pulled in small slices, executed quickly,
and integrated through the guardrail pack.
Execution is allowed to be creative. Integration
is not. When integration becomes uncertain, the
unit treats it as a signal that verification or
constraints are underspecified.

[1m[1;37mLoop B: Daily evidence alignment[0m is a brief,
disciplined check-in. The point is not status. The
point is to look at signals and decide whether the
current hypothesis still deserves belief. This
loop is where the humans ensure they still share
the same intent and theory of value. If they do
not, they update the intent card, not each other.

[1m[1;37mLoop C: Weekly governance and learning[0m is where
the unit improves its own operating system. This
is when guardrails are tightened, recurring
failure modes are eliminated, and the unit reduces
future verification cost by investing in
automation. This loop is also where conceptual
integrity is protected: if the system is becoming
incoherent, this is where boundaries are clarified
and contracts are made explicit.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mHow work actually moves[0m

A centaur unit begins by creating an intent card.
The title should be a full intent statement, not a
slogan, because intent is easiest to lose when
compressed into marketing language. The body of
the card makes constraints explicit and ties the
work to observable signals. If the unit cannot
name a plausible signal, it does not yet
understand the outcome.

From the intent card, the unit selects one
micro-experiment. This is the smallest move that
could produce evidence, reduce uncertainty, or
strengthen the verification harness. The
micro-experiment is written so it can be
falsified. It should be obvious what would make
the unit stop and change course. If nothing could
falsify the experiment, it is not an experiment;
it is a hope.

Execution proceeds as a pull system with low WIP.
The unit allows itself to generate quickly, but it
does not allow itself to merge quickly without
proof. "Done" means integrated through guardrails,
not merely implemented. Outcome validation is
separate: it is measured through signals, not
asserted.

When an event occurs that changes understanding,
the unit performs a micro-review immediately. The
review is short, factual, and aimed at system
improvement. It answers what was expected, what
happened, why it likely happened, and what changes
now.

Micro-reviews are [1m[1;37mblameless[0m by design:

[36m-[0m no naming/shaming (capture lessons without
  attribution),
[36m-[0m no interruptions (let each person finish a
  thought),
[36m-[0m separate facts from explanations,
[36m-[0m always produce a concrete system change
  (guardrail, constraint, signal, or next
  experiment). If the review does not change the
  system, it is theatre.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mDefault accountabilities (capability-based, not[0m
   [1;34mtitles)[0m

The Centaur Manifest avoids role prescriptions,
but small units benefit from explicit default
accountabilities. These defaults reduce drift and
ensure the two core truths—domain truth and
systems truth—remain continuously covered.

[1m[1;37mDomain accountability[0m focuses on what matters and
how to know:

[36m-[0m expresses intent in domain language and stakes,
[36m-[0m defines signals of success and failure,
[36m-[0m gathers evidence from users, stakeholders, or
  operations,
[36m-[0m clarifies constraints that come from reality
  rather than preference.

[1m[1;37mBuilder accountability[0m focuses on what must hold
and how to prove it:

[36m-[0m maintains architecture and boundaries/contracts,
[36m-[0m builds verification harnesses (tests, checks,
  observability),
[36m-[0m protects operational fitness (deploy/rollback,
  failure modes, SLOs),
[36m-[0m manages integration risk under rapid change.

In many units, one person leans domain and another
leans builder. In others, the builder set spans
multiple people. The important property is not the
split; it is that both sets of accountabilities
remain owned.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mOperating discipline for AI-augmented work[0m

Centaur work assumes a particular posture toward
AI: delegate execution aggressively, but express
the work in terms that keep the unit aligned and
safe.

In practice, the unit communicates intent to
agents using four elements: the outcome, the
constraints, the acceptance criteria, and the
proof obligations. The unit asks agents to propose
and implement, but it requires agents to justify
changes with evidence and to produce artifacts
that make verification cheaper, not harder. Any
non-trivial change is incomplete until it includes
its verification story.

When an agent is uncertain, the correct behavior
is not to guess more confidently. The correct
behavior is to narrow the hypothesis, reduce
scope, and seek evidence sooner.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mScaling and composition (when there is more[0m
   [1;34mthan one unit)[0m

The centaur kernel works best when the unit is
small and dependencies are minimal. When you have
multiple units, the failure mode shifts from [3m[34mlocal[0m
[3m[34mthrash[0m to [3m[34mportfolio incoherence[0m.

Use these minimal composition rules:

   [1m[1;37mnon-prescriptive.[0m

   [36m-[0m If the org uses an outcome framework (e.g.,
     OBAF), treat its north-star artifacts as
     upstream intent.
   [36m-[0m Your unit does not "run" the org framework
     internally; instead, you [1m[1;37mmap[0m your Intent Card

     suspect.

[36m3)[0m [1m[1;37mDependencies are contracts, not conversations.[0m

   [36m-[0m For each external dependency, define a
