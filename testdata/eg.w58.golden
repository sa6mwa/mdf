[1;35m### [0m[1;35m2. Clarify the Purpose of the Outcome[0m

Ensure the team understands why the outcome matters—its
strategic, operational, or user-centered importance—before
starting the work. Quality attributes often define what
"good" looks like for a given outcome. Teams should
clarify which attributes (e.g., usability, reliability,
performance, security) are essential for success, and
ensure those are explicitly part of the intended impact.
