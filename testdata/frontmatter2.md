# The Centaur Manifest

Most teams don’t actually have a "speed" problem. They have a *change fear* problem.

Not because people are timid, but because the system doesn’t make truth cheap. When a change lands, nobody can quickly answer the questions that matter: What did we intend? What did we break? How do we know? What’s the smallest experiment that falsifies the wrong path?

The Centaur Manifest is a direct response to that reality. It’s not a manifest about hype. It’s a compact operating doctrine for small, high-leverage teams that want to move fast *and* stay coherent - especially when AI agents can multiply both throughput and variance.
