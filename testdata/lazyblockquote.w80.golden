[1;35m### [0m[1;35mBlockquotes[0m

Markdown uses email-style [35m>[0m characters for blockquoting. If you're familiar with
quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a
blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a [35m>[0m
before every line:

[90m>[0m This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
[90m>[0m consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum
[90m>[0m enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem
[90m>[0m consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the [35m>[0m before the first line of a
hard-wrapped paragraph:

[90m>[0m This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
[90m>[0m consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum
[90m>[0m enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

[90m>[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem
[90m>[0m consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding
additional levels of [35m>[0m:

[90m>[0m This is the first level of quoting.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [90m>[0m This is nested blockquote.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Back to the first level.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and
code blocks:

[90m>[0m [1;34m## [0m[1;34mThis is a header.[0m
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [36m1.[0m This is the first list item.
[90m>[0m [36m2.[0m This is the second list item.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Here's some example code:
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [32mreturn shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");[0m

Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For example, with
BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase Quote Level from the Text
menu.
