[1;32m# [0m[1;32mThe Outcome-Based Agile Framework[0m

In a world where agile has often been diluted into process
rituals without purpose, the [3m[34mOutcome-Based Agile Framework[0m
reclaims its core intent: to create meaningful change
through adaptive learning and value delivery. Inspired by
the original [4m[1;34mAgile Manifesto[0m ([90mhttps://agilemanifesto.org/[0m),
this framework defines a model where teams are driven by
[1m[1;37moutcomes[0m, [1m[1;37mnot requirements[0m, and guided by evidence, not
assumption.

[90m>[0m [1m[3m[1;35mCommon Misreadings[0m
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [36m-[0m [1m[1;37m"No Upfront Requirements"[0m does [1m[1;37mnot[0m mean chaos. It means
[90m>[0m   starting with [1m[1;37mintent[0m, not [1m[1;37mspecification[0m.
[90m>[0m [36m-[0m [1m[1;37m"Governance exists to support autonomy"[0m does [1m[1;37mnot[0m imply
[90m>[0m   lack of structure. It means governance should [1m[1;37menable[0m,
[90m>[0m   not [1m[1;37mcontrol[0m.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mManifesto[0m

We are uncovering better ways of creating value by focusing
on outcomes rather than outputs. Through this work, we have
come to value:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mOutcomes over requirements[0m
  Because solving problems matters more than delivering
  predetermined solutions.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mConstraints over scope[0m
  Because framing the problem is more productive than
  prescribing its answer.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mDiscovery over certainty[0m
  Because we can’t predict value—we must find it through
  learning.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mAccountability to results over compliance to plans[0m
  Because teams should be responsible for making change, not
  just delivering work.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mAlignment on intent over agreement on features[0m
  Because shared goals outlast specific ideas.

That is, while there is value in outputs, defined scopes,
and planned features, [1m[1;37mwe value the ability to learn and[0m
[1m[1;37madapt toward real outcomes far more.[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mFramework Tenets[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m1. No Upfront Requirements[0m

Work does not begin with a list of features, specifications,
or outputs. Teams begin with problems to solve and outcomes
to achieve. The only fixed inputs are constraints.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m2. Clarify the Purpose of the Outcome[0m

Ensure the team understands why the outcome matters—its
strategic, operational, or user-centered importance—before
starting the work. Quality attributes often define what
"good" looks like for a given outcome. Teams should clarify
which attributes (e.g., usability, reliability, performance,
security) are essential for success, and ensure those are
explicitly part of the intended impact.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m3. Problem Ownership Over Task Execution[0m

Teams are given ownership of a problem and trusted to
determine how best to solve it within the defined
boundaries.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m4. Outcomes Are Observable Changes[0m

An outcome is a measurable shift in user behavior, business
value, or system performance. Delivery is only valuable if
it contributes to these shifts. This includes improvements
in non-functional areas like usability, system reliability,
deployment efficiency, and security. Quality attributes must
be observable and verifiable as part of outcome validation.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m5. Constraints Define Limits, Not Solutions[0m

Constraints—technical, legal, ethical, or otherwise—are real
and respected. They inform exploration but must not dictate
the final form of a solution.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m6. Continuous Discovery Is Mandatory[0m

Discovery and delivery happen together. Teams explore
problems, test assumptions (solution hypotheses), and
validate ideas in real time. This includes discovering which
quality attributes matter most in the context and validating
them with users or stakeholders continuously.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m7. Evidence Is the Arbiter[0m

All decisions are made based on learning from real users and
data. [1m[1;37mPlans are hypotheses[0m, not contracts.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m8. Strategy Is Intent, Not Instruction[0m

Leaders set direction through vision and desired outcomes,
not through detailed feature roadmaps.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m9. Simplicity of Governance[0m

Governance exists to support autonomy and learning. It must
be light, minimal, and enabling—never controlling.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m10. Regular Blameless Retrospectives Through After[0m
    [1;35mAction Reviews (AAR)[0m

Teams must conduct regular retrospectives at intervals
appropriate to their context (after iterations, deliveries,
daily, weekly, or combinations). The recommended format is
the [3m[34mAfter Action Review[0m (AAR), which uses four blameless and
structured questions:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mWhat was supposed to happen?[0m (What was planned?)
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mWhat happened?[0m (What actually occurred?)
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mWhy did it happen?[0m (Root causes and contributing factors)
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mWhat did we learn?[0m (Key insights and adaptations)

Each question is discussed separately and sequentially by
the entire team. Conversations about "what was planned,"
"what happened," and "why" must be isolated from each other
to avoid conflating facts and analysis. Learning points can
be documented at any time in the "what did we learn"
section.

Differences in team members' understanding are celebrated as
learning opportunities rather than treated as errors. The
goal is not for all team members to have identical views but
to explore the richness of different perspectives.

It is considered rude to interrupt team members while they
are speaking. The facilitator should ensure that each team
member has the opportunity to speak without interruption and
can finish sharing their thoughts before others respond.

Importantly, the "what did we learn" section, including any
optional recording in a knowledge base, must never include
the names of individual team members. Only lessons learned,
without attribution to specific people, are captured to
ensure a fully blameless environment that fosters openness
and continuous improvement.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mHow to Apply This Framework[0m

[90m>[0m [1m[1;37mStart small:[0m Before applying the framework to any
[90m>[0m initiative—whether one, many, or all—begin with the
[90m>[0m Readiness Assessment in the next section. It will help you
[90m>[0m evaluate whether your teams, culture, and leadership are
[90m>[0m prepared for outcome-driven ways of working. The results
[90m>[0m will highlight strengths to build on, surface gaps to
[90m>[0m address, and guide a pace of adoption that fits your
[90m>[0m context—ensuring the framework supports rather than
[90m>[0m overwhelms.

Organizations adopting Outcome-Based Agile should begin by
clearly defining the outcomes they seek. These outcomes
should not only be real, measurable changes in user or
business behavior but also have a clearly articulated
purpose. Clarifying [3m[34mwhy[0m each outcome matters helps ensure
alignment across teams, guides prioritization, and connects
day-to-day work to broader organizational goals.

In defining and pursuing outcomes, teams should explicitly
consider which quality attributes are critical to achieving
the desired change. These attributes—such as security,
suitability, usability, reliability, maintainability,
compatibility, or deployment efficiency—must be treated as
part of the outcome, not as secondary requirements. Quality
attributes should be framed as hypotheses to test, measured
as part of delivery, and evaluated through direct feedback
and evidence, not assumed as implicit side effects of
feature development.

Teams should be cross-functional, capable of discovery and
delivery, and given end-to-end responsibility for their
outcomes.

[1m[1;37mRoadmaps become hypothesis backlogs[0m. Requirements become
constraints. Progress is measured not by story points, but
by progress toward the desired change.

Leadership must shift from steering work to enabling
learning. Teams must shift from implementing solutions to
exploring possibilities. And the organization must create
space for evidence to matter more than certainty.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mRecommended Implementation[0m

This framework [1m[1;37mrecommends—not prescribes—a structured yet[0m
[1m[1;37madaptable approach[0m to outcome-driven planning and
experimentation. It provides a practical system for making
not just work visible, but also for surfacing [1m[1;37mintent,[0m
[1m[1;37mconstraints, signals, learnings, and measurable results[0m.

At its core is a [1m[1;37m1+5 nested loop[0m, designed to align rapid
action with reflective learning. This structure guides teams
through continuous cycles of intent-setting,
hypothesis-building, execution, and adaptation—without
imposing rigid process overhead.

The six parts of the loop are:

[36m0.[0m Establish Feedback Loops Early
[36m1.[0m Create an Outcome Card
[36m2.[0m Initialize an Experiment Canvas
[36m3.[0m Plan Using the Recognitional Planning Model (RPM)
[36m4.[0m Translate CoA into Executable Tasks via an Exploratory
   Kanban Board
[36m5.[0m Facilitate After Action Reviews (AARs)

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m0. Establish Feedback Loops Early[0m

Before initiating any outcome or experiment, prioritize the
creation of [1m[1;37minstant or near-instant feedback mechanisms[0m that
are specific to your domain and operational context. These
loops form the backbone of your ability to validate
decisions in real-time and to pivot based on emerging
insights.

Without timely feedback, experimentation risks becoming
guesswork. Feedback loops ensure that learning is
continuous, grounded, and actionable.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mTip: Consider making this one of your first Outcome[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mCards—ensuring early visibility into what’s working and[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mwhat’s not.[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m1. Create an Outcome Card[0m

Start by defining a clear, focused [1m[1;37mintent[0m that communicates
the outcome you aim to achieve. The [1m[1;37mOutcome Card[0m acts as a
central alignment artifact—anchoring planning,
experimentation, and execution in a shared understanding of
purpose, constraints, and context.

The Outcome Card should be concise yet rich enough to guide
action and adaptation. Populate it with the following
elements:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mContext[0m – The situational background or environmental
  conditions that give rise to the need for action. This
  ensures that all stakeholders understand the circumstances
  under which the intent is being pursued.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mIntent[0m – Expressed as a combination of:
  [36m-[0m [1m[1;37mEnd-State[0m – The desired result or condition to be
    achieved.
  [36m-[0m [1m[1;37mConstraints[0m – Boundaries that must not be violated
    (e.g., safety, policy, cost).
  [36m-[0m [1m[1;37mPurpose (IOT)[0m – The strategic or operational rationale
    behind the intent; typically phrased as [3m[34m“in order to...”[0m

    [90m>[0m [1m[1;37mExample:[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34mIntent: "Prevent the fire from reaching the gas[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34mstation (end-state), without risking firefighter[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34msafety (constraint), in order to maintain critical[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34minfrastructure and avoid civilian casualties[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34m(purpose)."[0m
    [90m>[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34mTip: Use the full intent statement as the title of the[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34mOutcome Card. This helps keep constraints visible and[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34mprevents them from silently transforming into[0m
    [90m>[0m [3m[34massumptions or rigid requirements.[0m

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mSignals of Success[0m – Preliminary indicators—quantitative
  or qualitative—that suggest progress toward the end-state.
  These can evolve over time but serve as an early compass
  for situational awareness and adaptation.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mQuality Attributes[0m – Non-functional or qualitative
  properties that help define what “good” looks like for the
  outcome. Examples may include [1m[1;37mresilience[0m, [1m[1;37mscalability[0m,
  [1m[1;37msafety[0m, or [1m[1;37mease of use[0m, depending on the domain.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mOwner[0m – The team accountable for exploring and delivering
  this outcome. This provides a clear point of ownership for
  planning, execution, and follow-through.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mTarget Timeframe[0m – A flexible but bounded estimate for
  when meaningful signals or results should emerge. It helps
  scope the experiment and prevent stagnation, while leaving
  room for complexity and adaptation.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mSupporting Outcomes[0m – Outcomes that contribute to the
  achievement of this primary intent. If an Outcome Card
  includes supporting outcomes, it is considered a
  [1m[1;37mnorth-star Outcome Card[0m—typically used at the
  departmental, portfolio, or organizational level to anchor
  strategic direction.

A [1m[1;37mnorth-star Outcome Card[0m should be [1m[1;37mbroad in definition[0m and
[1m[1;37mnon-prescriptive[0m—avoiding early commitments to specific
technologies, solutions, or metrics. Its role is to align
diverse efforts without constraining how they’re executed.

North-star Outcome Cards [1m[1;37mdo not require an Experiment[0m
[1m[1;37mCanvas[0m, though they may include one if exploration or
iteration at the strategic level is needed. Their progress
is often tracked through high-level [1m[1;37msignals of success[0m and
realized through the coordinated impact of supporting
outcomes.

Each [1m[1;37msupporting outcome[0m must be documented in its own
Outcome Card and [1m[1;37mmust include an associated Experiment[0m
[1m[1;37mCanvas[0m. This ensures that supporting outcomes are
actionable, testable, and owned—allowing teams to iterate,
adapt, and deliver in alignment with the broader intent.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mTip: Use supporting outcomes to translate strategic goals[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34minto concrete work across teams—maintaining clarity of[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mdirection while enabling decentralized execution.[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m2. Initialize an Experiment Canvas[0m

After defining your Outcome Card, the next step is to set up
an [1m[1;37mExperiment Canvas[0m. This canvas serves as the operational
bridge between [1m[1;37mintent[0m and [1m[1;37mexecution[0m, capturing the
hypothesis, tasks, and learning that emerge throughout the
experimentation cycle. It is designed to evolve over time
and supports structured reflection, making learning explicit
and reusable.

The OBAF-format Experiment Canvas is made up of seven
hexagons—six arranged in a circle around a central one. Each
outer hexagon connects directly to the center, which anchors
the experiment to its strategic outcome. The outer hexagons
are positioned like points on a clock face, and moving
clockwise through them mirrors the natural flow of running
an experiment—from forming a hypothesis to capturing results
and learnings. This structure helps keep every part of the
experiment aligned with its intended outcome and purpose.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m1. Center Hexagon – Outcome Definition[0m

At the center of the canvas is the outcome definition,
representing the strategic objective the experiment is
ultimately serving. This hexagon contains the linked [1m[1;37mOutcome[0m
[1m[1;37mCard[0m, which anchors the work to the broader outcome
portfolio and provides traceability between the strategic
goals and the experiment being conducted. Everything else in
the canvas connects back to this core definition,
maintaining alignment with the intended impact.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m2. 12 o’clock – Hypothesis (Course of Action)[0m

At the top of the canvas is the hexagon that holds the
hypothesis under test. This is expressed as a [3m[34mCourse of[0m
[3m[34mAction[0m (CoA), developed during the RPM planning session. The
hypothesis should be a clearly stated, testable
assumption—describing what you expect will happen if a
particular action is taken. It links a proposed intervention
to an anticipated outcome, allowing the team to validate or
challenge that assumption through experimentation. To
provide clarity and structure, the Course of Action is
ideally broken into three phases: [1m[1;37minitially[0m, to outline the
first steps; [1m[1;37mthereafter[0m, to describe the follow-on actions;
and [1m[1;37mfinally[0m, to define how the effort will conclude or
transition.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mLeave this blank until the planning session has produced a[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mCoA.[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m3. 1:30 – Evaluation Criteria[0m

Moving clockwise, the next hexagon defines the evaluation
criteria for the experiment. This includes the thresholds,
conditions, or boundaries that determine whether the
hypothesis can be considered valid. It sets the standards
against which success will be judged, such as acceptable
tolerances or target ranges, and is critical for determining
when to pivot, persevere, or stop the experiment altogether.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m4. 4:30 – Metrics[0m

The next hexagon contains the metrics that will be observed
and measured throughout the experiment. These signals
provide evidence of whether the intended outcomes are being
achieved. Metrics may be quantitative, such as performance
indicators or usage statistics, or qualitative, such as user
behavior or feedback themes. They should be directly
relevant to both the evaluation criteria and the defined
outcome, providing insight into whether progress is being
made.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mOptionally, leave this blank until after the planning[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m5. 6 o’clock – Experiment Steps[0m

At the bottom of the canvas are the experiment steps, which
describe the concrete actions that will be taken to test the
hypothesis. These steps are based on the Course of Action
and typically translate into tasks managed through the
[1m[1;37mExploratory Kanban[0m board. The steps should be practical and
testable, enabling focused execution while allowing for
rapid learning through iteration.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mLeave this blank until after the planning session.[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m6. 7:30 – Outputs[0m

Continuing clockwise, this hexagon lists the outputs
generated during the experiment. These are tangible
artifacts or deliverables that result from executing the
steps of the Course of Action. Outputs might include code
commits, releases, deployments, documentation, prototypes,
decisions, or other forms of evidence that something has
been built, tested, or delivered as part of the experiment.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m7. 10:30 – Results and Learnings[0m

The final hexagon captures the results and learnings from
the experiment. This space is progressively populated
through [1m[1;37mAfter Action Reviews (AARs)[0m, which reflect on what
occurred during execution. It documents the observed
outcomes, whether expected or not, and records the insights
gained. Learnings may come from both success and failure and
are essential for refining future hypotheses or adjusting
strategy.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m3. Plan Using the Recognitional Planning Model (RPM)[0m

Conduct a focused planning session using the [1m[1;37mRecognitional[0m
[1m[1;37mPlanning Model[0m, which supports rapid, experience-driven
decision-making—especially under uncertainty, time pressure,
or incomplete information. Rather than evaluating multiple
alternatives, RPM relies on pattern recognition to generate
a single, viable [1m[1;37mCourse of Action (CoA)[0m based on the
decision-maker’s mental model of the situation.

This CoA becomes your [1m[1;37moperational hypothesis[0m, a testable
narrative of how the outcome will be achieved under the
given constraints and context.

Update the [1m[1;37mExperiment Canvas[0m with the following elements:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mHypothesis CoA[0m – Capture the planned course of action in a
  narrative format, ideally structured as a three-phase
  progression: [3m[34m“Initially, we...; thereafter, we...; and[0m
  [3m[34mfinally, we...”[0m
  This storytelling form improves clarity, alignment, and
  memory recall—especially in complex or time-critical
  operations.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mEvaluation Criteria[0m – Define what success looks like by
  specifying thresholds, tolerances, or boundaries that must
  be met for the outcome to be considered achieved.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mMetrics[0m – Identify the signals—both quantitative and
  qualitative—that will be used to track progress and
  validate whether the intended effects are occurring.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mFalsifiability Check[0m – Confirm that the hypothesis is
  [1m[1;37mtestable and falsifiable[0m, ensuring that failure to achieve
  the expected outcome can be clearly recognized and learned
  from.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m4. Translate CoA into Executable Tasks[0m

Convert the CoA into a set of small, testable [1m[1;37mexecution[0m
[1m[1;37mtasks[0m. These tasks enter the [1m[1;37mExploratory Kanban Board[0m, where
the focus is on maintaining momentum while preserving the
ability to learn and adjust. The board is optimized for flow
and responsiveness, supporting:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mLimited batch size[0m – Prevent buildup of large queues and
  reduce overloaded work-in-progress (WIP).
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mSmall work items[0m – Scope tasks tightly to enable rapid
  feedback and easier course correction.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mContinuous integration[0m – Ensure that insights,
  deliverables, and results are continuously folded back
  into both the [1m[1;37mExperiment Canvas[0m and any relevant technical
  workflows, such as code merges and deployments.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m5. Facilitate After Action Reviews (AARs)[0m

Schedule [1m[1;37mregular After Action Reviews[0m, or trigger them
contextually—for example, when the backlog runs thin or a
natural breakpoint occurs in execution. AARs are essential
for institutionalizing learning and deciding whether to
reinforce, adjust, or abandon a given CoA.

In each AAR:

[36m-[0m Compare outcomes to the hypothesis
[36m-[0m Assess what succeeded, failed, or surprised
[36m-[0m Update the [1m[1;37mExperiment Canvas[0m with:

  [36m-[0m Refined metrics and indicators
  [36m-[0m New contextual insights
  [36m-[0m Results and documented learning

These updates may inform refinements to the current Outcome
Card or trigger a new iteration of the planning and
experimentation cycle.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mRecognitional Planning Model[0m

The [1m[1;37mRecognitional Planning Model (RPM)[0m is a cognitive
decision-making framework originally developed within
military and emergency response contexts, particularly in
high-stakes environments where rapid yet effective decisions
are needed despite uncertainty or incomplete information.
Its foundations trace back to the work of Gary Klein and
others studying [1m[1;37mnaturalistic decision-making[0m—how experts
make fast, effective choices based on experience rather than
exhaustive analysis.

The term "recognitional" reflects the core mechanism of the
model: rather than generating and comparing multiple
detailed options from scratch (as in traditional decision
theory), experienced practitioners [1m[1;37mrecognize familiar[0m
[1m[1;37mpatterns or situations[0m, which trigger [1m[1;37mpre-formed mental[0m
[1m[1;37mmodels or scripts[0m for what to do. These scripts are then
quickly evaluated for fit. If they seem workable, they are
executed with minimal delay. If not, they are adapted or
rejected, and another option is tried. In short, it's not
about calculating the best plan, but identifying a "good
enough" one based on what’s known right now.

OBAF (Outcome-Based Adaptive Framework) draws from RPM to
empower teams to [1m[1;37mmove from strategy to action[0m efficiently
without being paralyzed by the need for perfect plans. In a
self-organizing, cross-functional team, RPM helps teams
generate a [1m[1;37mCourse of Action (CoA)[0m rooted in shared
understanding, lived experience, and the situational
context—rather than top-down directives or speculative
analysis.

RPM is especially well-suited for environments where:

[36m-[0m Conditions are changing or ambiguous.
[36m-[0m Information is incomplete but action is still required.
[36m-[0m The team has enough collective experience to recognize
  useful patterns and plausible next steps.
[36m-[0m Rapid experimentation and adaptation are valued over rigid
  execution.

When applied to planning within an OBAF context, RPM
supports the creation of an experiment-ready CoA that is
simple, realistic, and immediately actionable. It enables
teams to move quickly toward testing while maintaining
alignment with strategic outcomes.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mHow to Apply RPM in a Planning Session[0m

When a team applies RPM, they are not brainstorming a long
list of potential ideas to analyze and debate. Instead, they
begin by identifying [1m[1;37mwhat is known[0m, [1m[1;37mwhat’s being observed[0m,
and [1m[1;37mwhat similar situations the team has seen before[0m. From
this, a plausible Course of Action naturally emerges—a
storyline of what to try next, based on judgment, relevance,
and feasibility.

The result is a CoA written in a storytelling format, broken
into three distinct phases:

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mInitially[0m

This phase sets the immediate next steps—the first actions
the team will take based on what is currently known and
achievable. It may involve establishing a starting point,
setting up conditions for experimentation, or initiating a
change. These steps should be clear, specific, and focused
on creating early signals or momentum.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mExample: “Initially, we will release the new onboarding[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mprompt to 10% of users on the signup page to observe[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mwhether it improves progression to the dashboard.”[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mThereafter[0m

This is the unfolding middle of the story—the reaction
phase. It outlines how the team will follow up based on
initial feedback or results, what further actions will be
taken, and how the hypothesis will evolve through
implementation.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mExample: “Thereafter, we will compare engagement metrics[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mbetween the test and control groups and run interviews[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mwith selected users who completed the new flow to[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34munderstand their experience.”[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mFinally[0m

This phase closes the loop. It describes the conditions or
criteria for wrapping up the experiment, scaling the
intervention, or shifting focus. It might include what will
happen if the hypothesis is confirmed or disproven, or how
the team will capture and share learnings.

[90m>[0m [3m[34mExample: “Finally, if we see a 20% or higher increase in[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mdashboard activation within the test group, we will roll[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mout the prompt to all users and update our user journey[0m
[90m>[0m [3m[34mmap to reflect this new entry pattern.”[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mThe Cognitive Engine[0m

RPM provides a pragmatic, grounded approach to
planning—especially suited to autonomous, cross-functional
teams working under uncertainty. By focusing on recognition,
experience, and iterative adaptation, it enables teams to
act with clarity and purpose. In OBAF, it is the cognitive
engine behind the Course of Action, helping turn strategic
intent into experiment-ready hypotheses that are both
testable and actionable.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mExploratory Kanban[0m

To support daily exploratory work in Outcome-Based Agile,
teams are encouraged to adopt a lightweight Kanban system
that promotes focus, flow, and learning across disciplines.
This system is not limited to software—it applies to any
kind of outcome-focused work, including research,
operations, design, service development, or policy.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mSuggested Columns[0m

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mReady for Development[0m – Items selected from the backlog,
  framed as hypotheses to explore
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mIn Development[0m (or [1m[1;37mDoing[0m, [1m[1;37mIn Process[0m, etc) – Items
  currently in active exploration, design, testing, or
  creation
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mReady to Test[0m – Work paused for review or integration,
  awaiting evaluation
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mTest[0m – Evaluation of fitness, coherence, quality
  attributes, or integration with other efforts
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mDone[0m – Complete and ready for delivery, use, or deployment

A [1m[1;37mBacklog[0m (or [1m[1;37mTo Do[0m) column contains the team's working
hypotheses. These are not verified answers but informed
bets. When the backlog becomes too shallow, it triggers a
discovery or planning session to replenish ideas grounded in
the outcome’s intent and constraints.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mPull System Across the Flow[0m

The system operates as a pull-based workflow:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mWork is never pushed forward.[0m Instead, each column [1m[1;37mpulls[0m
  from the previous one when capacity allows and context is
  ready.
[36m-[0m When work in the [1m[1;37mIn Development[0m (or Doing) column is
  complete, it is moved to [1m[1;37mReady to Test[0m, not directly into
  [1m[1;37mTest[0m. This ensures it is [1m[1;37mexplicitly pulled into validation[0m
  when the team has capacity and focus.
[36m-[0m Similarly, teams [1m[1;37mpull work from the Backlog into Ready for[0m
  [1m[1;37mDevelopment[0m, ensuring prioritization is intentional and
  capacity-aware.

This pull mechanism prevents overload, respects WIP limits,
and encourages reflection at each transition. It reinforces
that movement between phases is a deliberate choice, not an
automatic step.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mWIP Limits[0m

To support team autonomy, sustainable pace, and continuous
learning, the columns [1m[1;37mReady for Development[0m, [1m[1;37mIn Development[0m,
and [1m[1;37mTest[0m should include [1m[1;37mWork In Progress (WIP) limits[0m. These
are flexible boundaries set by the team to reveal
bottlenecks, maintain smooth flow, and foster intentional
decision-making—rather than rigid rules imposed externally.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mValidation Happens Outside the Board[0m

This board reflects internal work readiness and
coordination—not outcome success. Actual validation of a
hypothesis happens through [1m[1;37mexternal metrics[0m, preferably
[1m[1;37mautomated and continuous[0m, such as behavior change, system
performance, or user engagement. The [1m[1;37mDone[0m column indicates
readiness for delivery, not proof of effectiveness.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mWhy This Flow Supports OBAF[0m

This Exploratory Kanban system enables:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mVisible exploration[0m of hypotheses
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mTeam-managed flow[0m based on capacity, not forced schedules
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mClear separation of working and validating[0m
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mAdaptive prioritization[0m grounded in outcomes
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mContinuous discovery[0m through parallel metrics and learning

It supports autonomy, encourages sustainable pace, and keeps
delivery aligned with real-world evidence—as Outcome-Based
Agile demands.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mValidation Outside the Board[0m

The Kanban board reflects the team’s internal readiness and
coordination—not the validation of actual outcomes.

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mValidation happens beyond the board[0m, through continuous,
  preferably automated, metrics (e.g., behavior change,
  system performance, user engagement).
[36m-[0m There are no predefined validation criteria before
  delivery, because outcomes cannot be fully anticipated.
[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mValidation is emergent[0m, based on real-world feedback and
  production use—via A/B tests, before-after comparisons, or
  system telemetry.

Equally important, OBAF emphasizes qualitative validation.
Insights from user interviews, observational research,
session recordings, and open-ended feedback provide context
and meaning that quantitative signals alone cannot capture.
These methods reveal why users behave the way they do, not
just what they do. Emerging technologies—such as AI-powered
sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and
real-time experience tracking—now make qualitative
validation more scalable and actionable than ever before.

The Outcome-Based Agile Framework treats both forms of
evidence as essential and complementary. Effective
validation blends data and dialogue, measuring behavior
while understanding intent. This ensures that outcomes are
not only observable but meaningful.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mCommon Anti-Patterns in Outcome Validation[0m

To maintain the integrity of outcome-based work, teams must
be mindful of common traps that quietly erode learning and
agility. These anti-patterns often emerge when metrics are
misused, constraints become overly rigid, or activity is
mistaken for value.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m1. Goodhart’s Law in Action[0m

[90m>[0m When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
[90m>[0m measure.

When teams fixate on hitting specific numbers (e.g.,
reducing bounce rate or increasing click-through), they may
lose sight of the underlying change that truly matters.
Metrics should serve as signals for exploration—not targets
to hit at any cost.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m2. Vanity Metrics[0m

Not all data is meaningful. Metrics like page views,
impressions, or internal velocity can create the illusion of
progress while masking stagnation. These vanity metrics look
good on dashboards but rarely reflect real user or business
outcomes. Prioritize signals that tie directly to meaningful
behavior change or value realization.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34m3. Constraint Creep[0m

Constraints exist to define safe boundaries—not to prescribe
solutions. Over time, teams often inherit outdated
specifications or interpret vague standards as fixed
requirements. This slow expansion of what’s considered
“non-negotiable” can quietly kill innovation. Revisit
constraints regularly to ensure they’re still valid,
contextual, and evidence-based.

[1m[1;37mWhat to do instead:[0m

[36m-[0m Use metrics as [1m[1;37mlearning tools[0m, not success criteria. Let
  signals inform, not dictate.
[36m-[0m Question the purpose behind each measurement. Ask, [3m[34m“What[0m
  [3m[34mdoes this really tell us?”[0m
[36m-[0m Revalidate constraints. Treat them as hypotheses
  too—especially when they block experimentation.

These reminders help teams stay focused on learning and
progress that matters—so validation remains a discovery
process, not a performance ritual.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mOutcome vs. Output[0m

A frequent challenge in applying outcome-based thinking is
the [1m[1;37mblurring between outcomes and outputs[0m, especially at the
team level. Outputs are [1m[1;37mthings we deliver[0m—features,
services, improvements. Outcomes are the [1m[1;37mobservable changes[0m
those outputs create in the real world.

[90m>[0m An output is [1m[1;37mdelivered[0m.
[90m>[0m An outcome is [1m[1;37mvalidated[0m by real-world evidence.

Teams often mistake improved functionality (e.g., "faster
page load") for outcomes, when the true goal is behavioral
or value-based (e.g., "more users complete the checkout
process").

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mExamples[0m

[36m1.[0m [1m[1;37mOutcome:[0m Users complete tasks faster
   [1m[1;37mSignals of change:[0m Higher task completion rates and a
   reduction in user drop-offs
   [1m[1;37mRelated outputs:[0m Page speed improvements and a
   streamlined user interface with fewer steps

[36m2.[0m [1m[1;37mOutcome:[0m More users set up their accounts through
   self-service
   [1m[1;37mSignals of change:[0m Increased percentage of accounts
   created without needing human assistance
   [1m[1;37mRelated outputs:[0m Redesigned onboarding experience and
   automated support tools

[36m3.[0m [1m[1;37mOutcome:[0m Fewer users require support for password issues
   [1m[1;37mSignals of change:[0m Lower volume of support tickets and
   positive user feedback
   [1m[1;37mRelated outputs:[0m Enhanced "Forgot Password" functionality
   and better input validation

[36m4.[0m [1m[1;37mOutcome:[0m Users trust billing processes more
   [1m[1;37mSignals of change:[0m Fewer billing-related complaints and
   higher Net Promoter Score (NPS)
   [1m[1;37mRelated outputs:[0m Clearer invoice layouts and helpful
   usage explanations via tooltips

[36m5.[0m [1m[1;37mOutcome:[0m Increased usage of the scheduling feature
   [1m[1;37mSignals of change:[0m Higher adoption and more frequent
   usage of the feature
   [1m[1;37mRelated outputs:[0m Launch of the feature, onboarding
   guidance, and supportive help content

[90m>[0m [1m[1;37mExample:[0m
[90m>[0m “Improve page load time” is an [1m[1;37moutput[0m (a quality
[90m>[0m attribute). “Increase checkout completion rate” is the
[90m>[0m [1m[1;37moutcome[0m. The former contributes to the latter, but [1m[1;37mis not[0m
[90m>[0m [1m[1;37mthe outcome itself[0m.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mTip for Teams[0m

When defining an outcome, ask:

[36m-[0m What will people [1m[1;37mdo differently[0m if this works?
[36m-[0m How will we [1m[1;37mobserve or measure[0m that change?
[36m-[0m Could the outcome be achieved [1m[1;37min multiple ways[0m?

Outcomes describe [1m[1;37mwhy something matters[0m and how success is
observed—not what to build.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mCross-Team Coordination and Outcome Ownership[0m

Outcomes should not be split across teams with different
priorities. To ensure coherence and ownership:

[36m-[0m Each outcome should belong to one clearly defined team or
  pod.
[36m-[0m If multiple teams contribute, they must act as a single
  outcome-focused unit.
[36m-[0m Organizational structures should evolve to reflect outcome
  boundaries (Conway’s Law in reverse).
[36m-[0m Interfaces and dependencies should be framed as contracts,
  not coordination burdens.

Teams are encouraged to reorganize when outcome ownership
becomes diluted or coordination overhead increases.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mLeadership and Oversight[0m

Leadership in OBAF means enabling, not directing. Oversight
should be nearly invisible:

[36m-[0m [1m[1;37mOptimal oversight is automated[0m: KPIs, usage data, or
  real-world impact signals.
[36m-[0m Leaders guide through vision and constraints—not feature
  lists or status reports.
[36m-[0m Interventions should only occur in cases of systemic
  failure, ethical risk, or learning breakdowns.
[36m-[0m Sponsors and managers should practice servant leadership —
  understood here as a facilitative approach — by funding
  experiments, supporting outcome framing, and modeling
  evidence-based decision-making.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mFrom Status-Reporting to Evidence-Framing[0m

For leaders and sponsors, shifting from traditional output
oversight to outcome enablement means more than changing
what gets tracked—it requires changing how conversations
happen.

In status-reporting cultures, reviews often focus on
surface-level indicators: percent complete, story points
burned, or tasks delivered. These measures are easy to
collect but rarely illuminate whether meaningful progress is
happening.

Evidence-framing transforms these conversations. Instead of
asking, [3m[34m“Are we on track?”[0m leaders ask, [3m[34m“What have we[0m
[3m[34mlearned?”[0m, [3m[34m“What signals are emerging?”[0m, and [3m[34m“What’s the[0m
[3m[34mcurrent level of confidence in the outcome?”[0m

This shift happens progressively, often in small steps:

[36m-[0m A delivery update evolves into a learning review, where
  the team shares new insights about user behavior or system
  feedback—not just what was built.
[36m-[0m Instead of tracking feature completion, leaders start
  watching for real-world signals that value is emerging
  (e.g., user adoption, friction reduction, behavior
  change).
[36m-[0m Weekly reports stop listing tasks and start summarizing
  discoveries, test results, and adjustments based on
  evidence.
[36m-[0m "Red-yellow-green" status summaries give way to
  qualitative confidence levels—rooted in both data and team
  insight.

As leaders adopt this posture, they stop asking for
certainty and start investing in clarity. They stop steering
by roadmap and start enabling exploration, grounded in trust
and observable impact.

The goal is not to eliminate accountability—but to make it
meaningful. When teams are asked to show [1m[1;37mevidence of[0m
[1m[1;37mlearning[0m, not just activity, accountability becomes a tool
for alignment, not control.

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mOutcome-Based Agile Readiness Assessment[0m

This [3m[34mReadiness Assessment[0m focuses on organizational, team,
and leadership readiness across five key dimensions. Each

      (e.g., usability, security)?
[36m-[0m [ ] Is the outcome flexible in [3m[34mhow[0m it’s achieved, but firm

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mApplying OBAF in Regulated Environments[0m

[90m>[0m This guidance exists to help reformers apply outcome-based
[90m>[0m thinking in [1m[1;37mnon-ideal contexts[0m, not to justify legacy
[90m>[0m approaches.

This complementary checklist is intended for teams operating
in highly regulated environments that require adherence to
contracting constraints, phase-gate processes, or sequential
development cycles such as the V-model. Although these
conditions are not ideal for agile practices, the checklist
helps incorporate outcome-based agile thinking within these
limitations. It also assists in identifying where existing
constraints support or conflict with OBAF principles,
encouraging a gradual shift toward more outcome-focused
contracting philosophies and practices.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m1. Frame Regulatory Needs as Immutable Constraints[0m

[36m-[0m [ ] Have all mandatory regulations, standards, or audit
      requirements been clearly identified and documented as
      [3m[34mnon-negotiable constraints[0m?
[36m-[0m [ ] Are these constraints understood by the team as
      guardrails, not deliverables?

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m2. Treat Compliance Evidence as Outcomes[0m

[36m-[0m [ ] Is the evidence of compliance (e.g., traceability,
      testing coverage, documentation) framed as part of the
      outcome definition?
[36m-[0m [ ] Are compliance deliverables produced iteratively and
      integrated into the workflow, not left to the end?

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m3. Enable Discovery Within the Boundaries[0m

[36m-[0m [ ] Have areas where flexibility is [3m[34mstill possible[0m (e.g.,
      usability, automation, user workflow) been clearly
      defined to allow innovation?
[36m-[0m [ ] Are hypotheses and solution exploration encouraged
      within the compliance envelope?

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m4. Automate Traceability and Documentation[0m

[36m-[0m [ ] Are tools or lightweight methods in place to
      automatically capture decision logs, test coverage,
      change history, or requirement links?
[36m-[0m [ ] Are compliance artifacts continuously validated
      instead of batch-generated?

[1;35m### [0m[1;35m5. Engage Risk and Compliance as Learning Partners[0m

[36m-[0m [ ] Are compliance/risk officers included early in framing
      outcomes and reviewing experiments?
[36m-[0m [ ] Is the compliance team encouraged to collaborate in
      defining what [3m[34mevidence[0m of safety or control looks
      like—rather than dictating process?

[1;32m# [0m[1;32mSummary[0m

Outcome-Based Agile is not a methodology; it is a
recommitment to what agility was always meant to be:
adaptive, user-centered, and value-focused. It is a call to
drop the illusion of control in favor of the pursuit of
clarity, progress, and real-world impact.
