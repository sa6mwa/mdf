[1;32m# [0m[1;32mThe Outcome-Based Agile Framework[0m

In a world where agile has often been diluted into process
rituals without purpose, the [3m[34mOutcome-Based Agile Framework[0m
reclaims its core intent: to create meaningful change
through adaptive learning and value delivery. Inspired by
the original [4m[1;34mAgile Manifesto[0m ([90mhttps://agilemanifesto.org/[0m),
this framework defines a model where teams are driven by
[1m[1;37moutcomes[0m, [1m[1;37mnot requirements[0m, and guided by evidence, not
assumption.
