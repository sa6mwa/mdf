This repo contains a markdown file which covers a lot of the
syntax. We use it for testing our markdown support.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mInspiration[0m

The file is based on [4m[1;34mthe source of John Gruber's Markdown[0m
[4m[1;34mSyntax page[0m
([90mhttps://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text[0m)
([4m[1;34mthis is the page rendered[0m
([90mhttps://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[0m)) with
all the HTML and some more complex stuff removed. (if you
want to support the full entirety of Markdown we'd recommend
just using the full page instead of this shortened version)

Full credits for that idea go to [4m[1;34mthis StackOverflow question[0m
