Much of the current discourse on AI productivity is framed around tools,
prompts, and workflows. That framing misses the deeper shift. What is changing
is not [3m[34mhow fast we type[0m, but how work is coordinated, how correctness is
maintained, and how skill is formed when execution becomes cheap.

Recent [4m[1;34mcommentary by Nate Jones[0m ([90mhttps://youtu.be/EZ4EjJ0iDDQ[0m) captures an
important part of this shift. His core claim—that effective AI use is
fundamentally a judgment and supervision skill, not a prompting trick—is
correct. The most productive AI users are those who can decompose work, give
clear intent, evaluate outputs, and course-correct. That looks like
"management," but it is better understood as operational judgment under
radically altered cost structures.

This aligns closely with what empirical research is now showing. The study [4m[1;34mHow[0m
[4m[1;34mAI Impacts Skill Formation[0m
([90mhttps://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills[0m) finds that AI
meaningfully boosts short-term productivity while simultaneously weakening deep
understanding and long-term skill acquisition when humans remain continuously
embedded in the execution loop. Users complete tasks faster, but learn less
about [3m[34mwhy[0m things work, and become worse at independent problem solving over
time. This is not a moral failure; it is a structural effect of delegating
cognition without restructuring verification.

Together, these perspectives point to the same underlying phenomenon: [4m[1;34ma[0m
[4m[1;34mcoordination shift[0m ([90m/posts/10x-coordination-shift/[0m).

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mFrom execution to supervision[0m

Historically, much professional skill was formed through repetitive execution.
Junior engineers learned by writing boilerplate, debugging trivial failures, and
slowly internalizing system behavior. AI collapses that pathway. Execution is
now cheap, abundant, and instant. What becomes scarce—and therefore valuable—is
the ability to [3m[34mdirect[0m execution and [3m[34mverify[0m outcomes.

This is why experienced architects and senior engineers often adapt quickly.
They already operate at the level of intent, constraints, and validation. For
them, AI is an accelerant. For others, especially those still forming
foundational skills, AI can become a crutch that produces results without
understanding.

This is the gap Nate gestures at with his "101 / 201 / 401" framing. Most
organizations stop at "101": tool introductions and prompt tips. Some reach
"201": basic workflows. Almost none reach what actually matters—explicit
training in judgment, verification, and failure analysis. The result is
predictable: surface productivity gains followed by silent quality decay.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mWhy "full integration" is a trap[0m

This is where the popular "cyborg" metaphor becomes actively misleading. The
idea that humans and AI form a single, fully integrated control loop suggests
something almost magical: a fused intelligence that outperforms either part
alone. In reality, there is no shared control loop. There are two distinct
agents, operating asynchronously, coordinated through artifacts.

When humans stay continuously inside the generative loop—what is often described
as "fully integrated" work—they blur thinking, generating, and validating into
one activity. This feels efficient, but it undermines correctness. Humans begin
to hallucinate alongside the model. Verification quietly disappears. In
software, this shows up as "vibe coding": rapid progress, followed by late
discovery that architecture drifted, invariants were never encoded, and tests
are missing or meaningless.

The alternative is not to slow down, but to structure work differently. Explicit
handoffs—intent, execution, verification—enable faster [3m[34mand[0m safer iteration. The
so-called "centaur" model is not less integrated; it is more disciplined.
Iteration still happens, but through observable, verifiable cycles rather than
continuous co-creation.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mSkill formation in the age of AI[0m

The real risk highlighted by both Nate’s argument and the skill-formation
research is not that people will become "worse" engineers. It is that
organizations will fail to redesign apprenticeship and evaluation models. If
juniors never practice verification, debugging, or boundary reasoning—because AI
fills in the answers—they will not develop the judgment required to supervise AI
later.

Banning AI is not the solution. Nor is unstructured enthusiasm. The solution is
to shift training and incentives away from raw output and toward proof: tests,
invariants, post-mortems, and explicit reasoning about failure modes. Skill
formation must move up the stack, just as execution has.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mThe real takeaway[0m

AI does not replace skill; it [3m[34mreprices[0m it. Execution is cheap. Judgment is
expensive. Organizations that treat AI as a productivity toy will get speed
without reliability. Those that treat it as a coordination problem—embedding
supervision, verification, and accountability into their workflows—will compound
advantage.

There is no cyborg future waiting to arrive. There is only better or worse
coordination. The centaur was never about myth or romance; it was about division
of labor. In that sense, the lesson is simple and uncomfortable: AI rewards
those who already know how to think clearly about systems, and it punishes those
who mistake fluency for understanding.

That is not a tooling problem. It is a design problem.
