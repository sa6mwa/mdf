Most teams don’t actually have a "speed" problem.
They have a [3m[34mchange fear[0m problem.

Not because people are timid, but because the
system doesn’t make truth cheap. When a change
lands, nobody can quickly answer the questions
that matter: What did we intend? What did we
break? How do we know? What’s the smallest
experiment that falsifies the wrong path?

The Centaur Manifest is a direct response to that
reality. It’s not a manifest about hype. It’s a
compact operating doctrine for small,
high-leverage teams that want to move fast [3m[34mand[0m
stay coherent - especially when AI agents can
multiply both throughput and variance.
