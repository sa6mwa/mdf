[1;34m## [0m[1;34mOverview[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mPhilosophy[0m

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write
as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A
Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as
plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with
tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has
been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters --
including [4m[1;34mSetext[0m
([90mhttp://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html[0m), [4m[1;34matx[0m
([90mhttp://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/[0m), [4m[1;34mTextile[0m
([90mhttp://textism.com/tools/textile/[0m), [4m[1;34mreStructuredText[0m
([90mhttp://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html[0m), [4m[1;34mGrutatext[0m
([90mhttp://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html[0m), and [4m[1;34mEtText[0m
([90mhttp://ettext.taint.org/doc/[0m) -- the single biggest source
of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain
text email.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mBlock Elements[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mParagraphs and Line Breaks[0m

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text,
separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any
line that looks like a blank line -- a line containing
nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal
paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of
text" rule is that Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text
paragraphs. This differs significantly from most other
text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type's "Convert
Line Breaks" option) which translate every line break
character in a paragraph into a [35m<br />[0m tag.

When you [3m[34mdo[0m want to insert a [35m<br />[0m break tag using
Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type
return.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mHeaders[0m

Markdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and
[atx] [2].

Optionally, you may "close" atx-style headers. This is
purely cosmetic -- you can use this if you think it looks
better. The closing hashes don't even need to match the
number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of
opening hashes determines the header level.)

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mBlockquotes[0m

Markdown uses email-style [35m>[0m characters for blockquoting. If
you're familiar with quoting passages of text in an email
message, then you know how to create a blockquote in
Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a
[35m>[0m before every line:

[90m>[0m This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
[90m>[0m dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
[90m>[0m hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra
[90m>[0m nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
[90m>[0m Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the [35m>[0m before the
first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:

[90m>[0m This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
[90m>[0m dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
[90m>[0m hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra
[90m>[0m nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

[90m>[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
[90m>[0m Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a
blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of
[35m>[0m:

[90m>[0m This is the first level of quoting.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [90m>[0m This is nested blockquote.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Back to the first level.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including
headers, lists, and code blocks:

[90m>[0m [1;34m## [0m[1;34mThis is a header.[0m
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [36m1.[0m This is the first list item.
[90m>[0m [36m2.[0m This is the second list item.
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m Here's some example code:
[90m>[0m
[90m>[0m [32mreturn shell_exec("echo $input | $markdown_script");[0m

Any decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy.
For example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and
choose Increase Quote Level from the Text menu.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mLists[0m

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered
(bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens --
interchangably -- as list markers:

[36m-[0m Red
[36m-[0m Green
[36m-[0m Blue

is equivalent to:

[36m-[0m Red
[36m-[0m Green
[36m-[0m Blue

and:

[36m-[0m Red
[36m-[0m Green
[36m-[0m Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

[36m1.[0m Bird
[36m2.[0m McHale
[36m3.[0m Parish

It's important to note that the actual numbers you use to
mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown
produces. The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is:

If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:

[36m1.[0m Bird
[36m2.[0m McHale
[36m3.[0m Parish

or even:

[36m3.[0m Bird
[36m4.[0m McHale
[36m5.[0m Parish

you'd get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you
want to, you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered
Markdown lists, so that the numbers in your source match the
numbers in your published HTML. But if you want to be lazy,
you don't have to.

To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging
indents:

[36m-[0m Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
  viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
[36m-[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

But if you want to be lazy, you don't have to:

[36m-[0m Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
  Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
  viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
[36m-[0m Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each
subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by
either 4 spaces or one tab:

[36m1.[0m This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum
   dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam
   hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

   Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
   vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
   sit amet velit.

[36m2.[0m Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent
paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be
lazy:

[36m-[0m This is a list item with two paragraphs.

  This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're only
  required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
  amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

[36m-[0m Another item in the same list.

To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's [35m>[0m
delimiters need to be indented:

[36m-[0m A list item with a blockquote:

  [90m>[0m This is a blockquote inside a list item.

To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs
to be indented [3m[34mtwice[0m -- 8 spaces or two tabs:

[36m-[0m A list item with a code block:

  [32m<code goes here>[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mCode Blocks[0m

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about
programming or markup source code. Rather than forming
normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted
literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both [35m<pre>[0m and
[35m<code>[0m tags.

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every
line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

This is a normal paragraph:

[32mThis is a code block.[0m

Here is an example of AppleScript:

[32mtell application "Foo"[0m
[32m    beep[0m
[32mend tell[0m

A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not
indented (or the end of the article).

Within a code block, ampersands ([35m&[0m) and angle brackets ([35m<[0m
and [35m>[0m) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This
makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using
Markdown -- just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will
handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle
brackets. For example, this:

[32m<div class="footer">[0m
[32m    &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation[0m
[32m</div>[0m

Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks.
E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code
block. This means it's also easy to use Markdown to write
about Markdown's own syntax.

[32mtell application "Foo"[0m
[32m    beep[0m
[32mend tell[0m

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mSpan Elements[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mLinks[0m

Markdown supports two style of links: [3m[34minline[0m and [3m[34mreference[0m.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square
brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses
immediately after the link text's closing square bracket.
Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link
to point, along with an [3m[34moptional[0m title for the link,
surrounded in quotes. For example:

This is [4m[1;34man example[0m ([90mhttp://example.com/[0m) inline link.

[4m[1;34mThis link[0m ([90mhttp://example.net/[0m) has no title attribute.

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mEmphasis[0m

Markdown treats asterisks ([35m*[0m) and underscores ([35m_[0m) as
indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one [35m*[0m or [35m_[0m will be
wrapped with an HTML [35m<em>[0m tag; double [35m*[0m's or [35m_[0m's will be
wrapped with an HTML [35m<strong>[0m tag. E.g., this input:

[3m[34msingle asterisks[0m

[3m[34msingle underscores[0m

[1m[1;37mdouble asterisks[0m

[1m[1;37mdouble underscores[0m

[1;35m### [0m[1;35mCode[0m

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes ([35m`[0m
). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates
code within a normal paragraph. For example:

Use the [35mprintf()[0m function.
