This repo contains a markdown file which covers a
lot of the syntax. We use it for testing our
markdown support.

[1;34m## [0m[1;34mInspiration[0m

The file is based on [4m[1;34mthe source of John Gruber's[0m
[4m[1;34mMarkdown Syntax page[0m
(https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/synt
ax.text) ([4m[1;34mthis is the page rendered[0m
(https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/synt
ax)) with all the HTML and some more complex stuff
removed. (if you want to support the full entirety
of Markdown we'd recommend just using the full
page instead of this shortened version)

Full credits for that idea go to [4m[1;34mthis[0m
