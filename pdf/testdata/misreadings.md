# The Outcome-Based Agile Framework

In a world where agile has often been diluted into process rituals
without purpose, the *Outcome-Based Agile Framework* reclaims its core
intent: to create meaningful change through adaptive learning and
value delivery. Inspired by the original
[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), this framework defines
a model where teams are driven by **outcomes**, **not requirements**,
and guided by evidence, not assumption.

> **_Common Misreadings_**
>
> * **"No Upfront Requirements"** does **not** mean chaos. It means
>   starting with **intent**, not **specification**.
> * **"Governance exists to support autonomy"** does **not** imply
>   lack of structure. It means governance should **enable**, not
>   **control**.

## Examples

   explanations via tooltips  

5. **Outcome:** Increased usage of the scheduling feature
